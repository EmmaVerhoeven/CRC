            <h1>engage 2025: Creative Research Crew</h1>

            <p>How can we find new ways to work together for a better future? <br>
                During <a href="https://www.engagerotterdam.nl/en-us/about">engage 2025</a> we explore this question
                through
                a series of workshops. As the Creative Research Crew, we approach Cool Zuid from different creative
                angles, seeking alternative perspectives. We test ways for residents, makers, and doers to collaborate
                more effectively.
                Each workshop in this series generates material that feeds into the next sessions: from stories and
                newspapers, to neighborhood maps and posters. Step by step, we build a collective investigation, with
                space for experimentation, imagination, and conversation.
                Whether you are a local resident or not, whether you join once or follow the entire program, your
                perspective and contribution are valuable! Together we create a multi-voiced picture of the
                neighborhood and the ways we can continue to work together in the future.</p>
